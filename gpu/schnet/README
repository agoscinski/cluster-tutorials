One can basically use the tutorial of schnetpack, one has to be just aware that the communicaton with the QM9 dataset will be a bottleneck for the calculations. So the dataset has be even loaded into the RAM when possible as in `schnet_ram.py`, or be moved to the fast temporary directory for the time of calculation (see io tutorials). Also downloading the dataset can result in problems because of certificate issues, therefore the dataset has to be downloaded outside of python or be moved to the server with scp.
