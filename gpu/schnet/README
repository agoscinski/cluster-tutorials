One can basically use the tutorial of schnetpack, one has to be just aware that the communicaton with the QM9 dataset will be a bottleneck for the calculations. To avoid this bottleneck the dataset can be loaded into the RAM as in `schnet_ram.py`, or if not possible, be moved to a faster temporary directory for the time of calculation (a faster local space will be available in near future, at the moment the home directory is the fastest option). Also downloading the dataset can result in problems because of certificate issues, therefore the dataset has to be downloaded outside of python or be moved to the server with scp.
