This folder contains the general job file to run a job on the GPU and load the NVIDIA SDK as in `gpu_job`.
You can also use the GPU node to run CPU calculations. Since the GPU node only has one GPU, you automatically can use the whole VRAM.
Some NVIDIA libraries (e.g. NPP) are not installed on the cluster as they did not seem to be important for our applications. If you require them, please let me know.
