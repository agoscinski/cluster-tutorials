Before you start to run the notebook on the remote server, set the jupyter notebook password on the remote server (on the frontend server)
```
jupyter notebook password
```

In general you can forward the notebook running on the remote server to your local machine by ssh tunneling with
```
ssh -t GASPAR_ACCOUNT@FRONTEND_SERVER_ADDRESS -L LOCAL_PORTS:localhost:LOCAL_PORTS ssh NODE_NAME -L REMOTE_PORTS:localhost:REMOTE_PORTS
```

To give a more concrete example a `notebook_job` file is offered which you can run on the server, wait until the job runs.
You can then bind the notebook on your local machine on port 8888 and forward it to the remote server with 
```
ssh -t -t GASPAR_ACCOUNT@FRONTEND_SERVER_ADDRESS -L 8888:localhost:8888 ssh imxcluster-08 -L 8889:localhost:8889
```
Now type in your browser
```
imxcluster-08:8888
```
and type the password you have set at the beginning.
