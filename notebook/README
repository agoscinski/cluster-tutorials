Before you start to run the notebook on the remote server, set the jupyter notebook password on the remote server (on the frontend server)

```
jupyter notebook password
```

Then you can use the job script `notebook_job.sh` to run the notebook on a server which binds the remote port 8889. Wait until the job runs (check with `squeue`). In general you can build an ssh tunnel from your local machine to a remotve node with

```
ssh -t <GASPAR_ACCOUNT>@<FRONTEND_SERVER_ADDRESS> -L <LOCAL_PORT>:localhost:<LOCAL_PORT> ssh <NODE_NAME> -L <REMOTE_PORT>:localhost:<REMOTE_PORT>
```

If you not already runnig some application on port 8888, you can bind the notebook on your local machine on port 8888 and forward it to the remote server with 

```
ssh -t <GASPAR_ACCOUNT>@<FRONTEND_SERVER_ADDRESS> -L 8888:localhost:8888 ssh <NODE_NAME> -L 8889:localhost:8889
```

where <NODE_NAME> can be seen in the output of the slurm job `slurm.out`. Now type in your browser

```
<NODE_NAME>:8888

```

and type the password you have set at the beginning.
